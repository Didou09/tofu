 INSTALLING TOFU ON WINDOWS
=============================

This is a quick tutorial on how to install and use ToFu on Windows.
It supposes you are an absolute beginner in coding. If you have some experience you can
probably skip some steps.


Before installing ToFu
======================

First things first: you will need a bash terminal. If you are running Windows 10, there are already some solutions
integrated with your system. Please google "Linux bash shell on Windows 10" to see the latest solutions available.
If you are running an older Windows, you will need to `install cygwin. <https://cygwin.com/install.html>`__
There are other solutions available, but you should have a bash terminal with *git* and *python* by the end of this step.

Required packages for cygwin
----------------------------

When installing `Cygwin` you will need to install the following packages (you can also install them after installing Cygwin, using `MinGW Installer`). List of packages:
  * `base-cygwin`
  * `bash`
  * `cmake`
  * `curl`
  * `git`
  * `emacs` or `vim` (for editting text/code)
  * `gcc-core`
  * `gcc-g++`
  * `gdb` (debugger)
  * `make`
  * `openssh`
  * `python3` (or `python2`)
