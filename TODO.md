# TODO list : Optimization of intersection LOS - TOR
- [x] Add a first test of inter between ray and bounding-box of structures
- [x] Cythonized inter bbox computation
- [x] Recreate function for matplotlib.Path.polygon.contains_point()
  -> speed up from x150 to x200
- [ ] Optimize inter between ray and frustum:
  - pre compute the fact is a line is horizontal or not: store information in array of size (Ns) or in a dynamic list that only keeps the index of segment of the polygon that are horizontal ? or as a long/int = sum of binary meaning True or False
- [ ] Use Forbid to ignore structures that are completly in the forbid zone
- [ ] "Ignore" a structure if the kout obtained from inter Bbox-Ray is bigger than last kout computed
  - Compute bbox when calling the Tor_Lim function and compare to last received SOut
- [ ] Inverse loop Poly-struct/Nlines (for parallelization) (?)
- [ ] Parellelize code
- [ ] Use new version of develop
- [ ] Memory profile code
- [ ] Compute bbox coordinates in cython ?
